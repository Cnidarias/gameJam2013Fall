GameJam 2013 in the Fall - Theme "Death is useful"


This is a 2D game written in C# using XNA 4.0

It was developed within 3 days, nothing is prefect coding quality is horrible - but for 3 days I think it turned out fine.

CONTROLS:
Move Left and Right with arrows
Jump with Left Shit
Escape is pause
Left Alt + Enter = Full Screen
R = Restart Level

AIM OF THE GAME:
Try to collect all skull tokens on every screen as quickly as possible! 
(How many tokens you need is shown in the top left corner)

In order to do so, you will need to kill yourself, because killing yourself leaves your dead body
as a platform! Which you can then use!

All levels have been tested and successfuly completed - ENJOY~

TODO:
Way too much, you dont even want to know.
